## 2.2.1
* To align with preferred terminology, we replaced instances of the word `portal` with the word `account`.  This was done in a non-breaking way, and any flag that currently accepts `account` will still accept `portal`.  The one exception to this migration is the `hubspot.config.yml` file.  We excluded this from the migration since it could potentially break backwards compatibility.  The `portals`, `portal`, and `defaultPortal` nomenclature will remain for `hubspot.config.yml` (https://github.com/HubSpot/hubspot-cms-tools/pull/394 and https://github.com/HubSpot/hubspot-cms-tools/pull/397)
