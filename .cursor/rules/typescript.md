# TypeScript Guidelines

When working with TypeScript files:

- Use strict type checking
- Follow functional programming patterns
- Avoid classes where possible
- Use descriptive variable names
- Keep module size small and focused (Unix philosophy)
- Use single quotes for strings
- Use 2-space indentation
- Use trailing commas in arrays and objects
- Keep lines under 80 characters
- Use early returns for readability
- Store type definitions in the `/types` directory
- Use ESM modules syntax
