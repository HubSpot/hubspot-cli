Publishing Releases
===================

We're using [lerna][lerna] to make managing multiple packages in the same repos easier.

Before releasing a new version, it is a good idea to release a prerelease so that folks can test out the changes.

## Publishing a new version

1. Run `yarn publish-release`. The publish command will handle bumping the version, tagging via git, and publishing the packages to NPM.
1. If there are publishing errors, you can run again via `yarn lerna publish from-package` ([Docs][from-package]).

## Publishing a prerelease

1. Run `yarn publish-prerelease`. The publish command will handle bumping the version, tagging via git, and publishing the packages to NPM under the `next` dist-tag.
1. If there are publishing errors, you can run again via `yarn lerna publish from-package --dist-tag next` ([Docs][from-package]).
