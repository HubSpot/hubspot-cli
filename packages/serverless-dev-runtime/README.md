# @hubspot/serverless-dev-runtime

A serverless function development runtime that can be used to test CMS serverless functions. This is intended for use with the [CMS CLI](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/cms/developer-reference/local-development-cms-cli).

⚠️ **This is a BETA release that uses some HubSpot features that are not available to all customer accounts. Please refer to the HubSpot [Developer Beta Terms](https://legal.hubspot.com/developerbetaterms)** ⚠️

## Getting started

For more information on using these tools, see [Local Development Tooling: Getting Started](https://designers.hubspot.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-local-development).

### Usage

#### CLI Command (recommended)
Using the CLI to run serverless functions locally, requires installing [@hubspot/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hubspot/cms-cli). Once installed, to test your functions run…

```bash
hs functions test <folder.functions>
```

#### Importing

It also is possible to use the runtime inside your own tooling. To start the server, the `start` method can be imported from the `@hubspot/serverless-dev-runtime` package and run with settings like so...

```bash
const { start } = require('@hubspot/serverless-dev-runtime');

start({
  accountId: <portalId/accountId>,                                                  // default: 123456
  contact: <booleanValueToSpecifyIfContactDataShouldBePassedToServerlessFunction>,  // default: true
  path: <pathToLocalDotFunctionsFolder>,                                            // required
  port: <customPortToRunServerOn>                                                   // default: 5432
});
```

### Mocked Data
Some of the data that is passed to the serverless function context is mocked. Specifically the `contact` and `limits` properties. It is possible
to modify the mocked data by setting values for specific variables within a `.env` file within the `.functions` folder.

The variables used to modify the data are:

```
HUBSPOT_LIMITS_TIME_REMAINING       // default: 600000
HUBSPOT_LIMITS_EXECUTIONS_REMAINING // default: 60
HUBSPOT_CONTACT_VID                 // default: 123
HUBSPOT_CONTACT_IS_LOGGED_IN        // default: false
HUBSPOT_CONTACT_LIST_MEMBERSHIPS    // default: []
```

Usage example `.env`:

```
HUBSPOT_LIMITS_TIME_REMAINING=1000
HUBSPOT_LIMITS_EXECUTIONS_REMAINING=2
HUBSPOT_CONTACT_VID=456
HUBSPOT_CONTACT_IS_LOGGED_IN=true
HUBSPOT_CONTACT_LIST_MEMBERSHIPS="some, memberships"
```


#### Private Apps - App Functions
There is some additional data that can be passed to an app function's serverless function context. As described above it is possible to modify the mocked
data by setting vlaues for specific variables within a `.env` file within the `..functions` folder


Usage example in `.env`
```
// ... previous usage example properties
HUBSPOT_ACCOUNT_ID: 123456
HUBSPOT_USER_ID: 12345
HUBSPOT_USER_EMAIL: "example@example.com"
PRIVATE_APP_ACCESS_TOKEN: "{INSERT_TOKEN_HERE}"
```
