> **ðŸ“¢ Repository Notice:** This repository is read-only. The HubSpot CLI has been moved to our internal GitHub organization for active development. While we continue to sync the latest changes to this public repository, all development work now happens internally. Issues can still be reported here, but pull requests will not be accepted.

Feedback about the HubSpot developer platform can be given through our [developer feedback form](https://developers.hubspot.com/feedback)
